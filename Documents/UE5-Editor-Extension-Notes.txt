Unreal Engine 5 Editor Extensions
===================================

======================================================
---------------------------------------
MODULES:
* Modules are basically building blocks for the ending
* Ensure good code separateion
* All moudles require a [ModuleName].Build.cs
  * In fact, every C++ project has one, e.g. EditorExtend.Build.cs
* Outside modules can be included by adding them to the Build.cs file

Modules:

Loading Phases:
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Projects/ELoadingPhase__Type?application_version=5.0

------------------
PLUGINS:
For this project, since all the functionality will be related to the Editor, a Plugin is perfect for this.

Creating a Plugin
* Edit -> Plugins -> click +Add
* There are multiple templates to choose from:
  * Blank, Content Only, Blueprint Library, Editor Mode, Editor Standalone Window, Editor Toolbar Button, Third Party Library

* For this project, we select Blank. This course will do everything from scratch so by the end, we will understand what all the templates do.
* The "Blank" project will appear in the Editor's Plugin list, but will NOT register any buttons or menu entries. We will do these manually.

NOTE:
* By creating a Plugin, you are ALSO creating a Module
* The Plugin name will be the Module name
  * So this is not something you can change later (?)
  * So choose your name carefully!

* Click Create Plugin after filling the Plugin Name field.

After the Plugin is created, you need to open the .uplugin file and change the following:
* In the Modules
* Type = "Runtime"  => If the plugin, will have impact on the game code, you want this to be "Runtime"
* "Type" = "Editor" => If it's only for the Editor
* "LoadingPhase" = "PreDefault" => Decides when the Module will be loaded, so now this Module will be loaded before the Game module. (Note we didnt say Plugin here)
