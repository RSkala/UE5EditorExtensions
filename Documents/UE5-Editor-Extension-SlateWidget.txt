Slate Widget
===============================

--------------------------------------------------
What is Slate:
* Unreal's Editor interface is larely built using Slate

Challenges with Slate
* Unique Syntax
* Hard to Visualize, since done all through code
* Communication with different modules

--------------------------------------------------
SMART POINTERS

* Designed to ease the burdern of memory allocation and tracking

Unreal Smart Pointer Library:
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/smart-pointers-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.4

Example:
Standard C++:
FExtender* MenuExtender = new FExtender()
...
delete MenuExtender; // MUST free the memory

Unreal C++:
TSharedRef<FExtender> MenuExtender(new FExtender())
...
Memory automatically freed

----------------------
4 Smart Pointer Types
* SharedPointers (TSharedPtr)
* SharedReferences (TSharedRef)
* WeakPointers (TWeakPtr)
* UniquePointers

Here, we are only going to be using first 3

======================================
Smart Pointer Properties

TSharedPtr 
* Owns the object: Yes
* Prevent Deletion: Yes, Reference Counting
* Unique Property: Can point to null

TSharedRef
* Owns the object: Yes
* Prevent Deletion: Yes
* Unique Property: Must point to a valid object

TWeakPtr
* Owns the object: No
* Prevent Deletion: No
* Unique Property: Breaks the reference cycle


NOTE:
* Smart Pointers cannot be used with UObject system!
* UObject system has its own garbage collection!
* i.e. an AActor class member variables must be marked as UPROPERTY()

The equivalent for UObjects is:
TWeakObjectPtr<AActor> MyActor

The difference between TWeakPtr and TWeakObjectPtr is that TWeakObjectPtr is designed specifically for handling UObjects

----------------
Syntax

TSharedRef<FExtender> MenuExtender(new FExtender())

Other ways to create these:
* MakeShareable()
* MakeShared()

TSharedRef<FExtender> MenuExtender = MakeShareable(new FExtender());

const FAssetData AssetData = UEditorAssetLibrary::FindAssetData(AssetPathName);
TSharedPtr<FAssetData> AssetDataSharedPtr = MakeShared<FAssetData>(AssetData);

MakeShared() is more efficient than MakeSharable()
